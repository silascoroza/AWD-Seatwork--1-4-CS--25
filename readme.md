## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This website lets you manage player information with ease. Both the homepage and player management page have a navigation menu to switch between them. On the homepage, you'll find a brief intro and a "Get Started" button that leads you to the player management page. There, you can store up to 10 players with their name, score, and level, view them in a list, and sort or search for players by name, score, or level.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project
This project is a Player Management System that allows users to store, manage, and view information about players. The system enables the user to input and store player names, scores, and levels, and display them in a table format. Additionally, it allows sorting of players by name, score, or level, and offers a search function to quickly find a specific player.

- Whats the purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use platform for managing and organizing player data, making it simple to track player performance and details. It's designed to help users efficiently manage up to 10 players, sort them based on various criteria, and search for specific players quickly. This system is ideal for managing player-related data for games, competitions, or any other activity where player information needs to be tracked and displayed.

- What technology used and how it is used

HTML:
How it's used: HTML is used to build the basic structure of the website. It creates things like the header, navigation menu, forms, and tables. For example, the homepage and player management page are made using HTML to organize the content and display it properly.

CSS:
How it's used: CSS makes the website look nice. It controls the colors, fonts, spacing, and layout of the page. It also makes sure the website works well on different devices, like phones and computers.

JavaScript:
How it's used: JavaScript adds interactive features to the website. It handles tasks like adding new players, sorting the player list, searching for players, and saving the data so it stays even after the page reloads. JavaScript makes the website respond to things you do, like clicking buttons or typing in search boxes.


### Key Components
<!-- TODO: List of Key Components -->
Homepage: The first page introduces the system, provides an overview of its purpose, and includes a "Get Started" button that redirects users to the player management page.

Player Management Page: This is where users can input and store player details (name, score, and level). It displays a table listing the players and includes sorting and search features.

Sorting: Users can sort the list of players by name, score, or level to easily organize and view the information.

Search Function: A search bar is included to help users find specific players by their name, making it quicker to locate the desired data.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
